==Donations
I have setup a donation site via [[http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462 | Pledgie]].  Feel free to donate if you like this mod.  I have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped me.  I did not write this mod with the intent to make any money from it.  I wrote it to help me with some needs that I saw in-game, and well with requests and my goal to make it filled with information it's become a massive project.

If you don't wish to donate money feel free to consider one of the following methods which may be more suitable:
* Volunteer time at your local animal shelter such as the [[http://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/|Society for Prevention of Cruelty for Animals (SPCA)]] or drop a few bucks off for them.  If you do this, please let [[http://www.wowace.com/home/send-private-message/|me]] know.
* Send [[http://www.wowace.com/home/send-private-message/|me]] some UDE Points.  These points are obtained from the [[http://www.wowtcg.com/|World of Warcraft TCG and Mini]] game.
* Send some gold to one of the authors in-game or help out with some achievements, or even send a message saying thanks. :)

*** Ackis is currently looking for a guild (along with his girlfriend).  We're looking for a guild which has competent people that can progress through the hard modes, aren't full of themselves and raids somewhat casually (2-3 nights a week).
